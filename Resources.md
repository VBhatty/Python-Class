####Textbooks you should consider for your own time
+ __Matplotlib for Python Developers__ [(Amazon link)](http://www.amazon.com/Matplotlib-Python-Developers-Tosi-Sandro/dp/1847197906/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1457436404&sr=8-5&keywords=matplotlib) - At times you may need to display various amounts of data, in python you'd do this with the module called **matplotlib**. and this is the book that tells you how to do it.

+ __High Performance Python__ [(Amazon link)](http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Python-Performant-Programming/dp/1449361595/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1457436832&sr=8-1&keywords=high+performance+python) - To those that say python is too slow, let them read and learn how to properly use the language. To be blunt, this is an important book to read and you should do so sooner rather than later.

+ __Violent Python__ [(Amazon link)](http://www.amazon.com/Violent-Python-Cookbook-Penetration-Engineers/dp/1597499579/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1457436972&sr=8-2&keywords=black+hat+python) - If you're interested in information security, python provides for very quick and easy ways to pen test computers and networks.

+ __Operating Systems Design and Implementation__ [(Amazon link)](http://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Design-Implementation-3rd/dp/0131429388/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1457437185&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=minux+book)) - Python doesn't run on bare metal, it runs in an operating system (OS). Here's a book to teach what that means. Though the MINUX OS isn't popular as other ones, it does provide for a great learning platform to build an understanding that can then be used on any other popular OS.

+ __Introduction to Algorithms__ [(Amazon link)](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1457437280&sr=8-1&keywords=intro+to+algorithms) - This is the book that will teach you what does it mean to write 'good code'. Once you have a understanding of python, this book is greatly recommended so that you can then learn how to take this basic tool you've learned, and how to turn it into an advance machine.
